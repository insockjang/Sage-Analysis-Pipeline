Sage-Analysis-Pipeline
======================
This is one of Sage analytical pipelines for drug mechanism discovery. 

A. Drug target rank discovery 
  Check if data driven model (feature selection) captures known target of drug well

B. Done at Aug. 14 2013
  - Pathway analysis with GSEA or FET codes
    Two pathway databases in Broad Institute and Bioconductor 
  1. MSigDB (without interaction information but high fidelity)
  2. Graphite (with interaction information but low fidelity)

C. Pathway Topology analysis will be considered
